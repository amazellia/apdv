					<p>	
						Hi, I'm Amanda Patricia Dorado Viray! (take a wild guess on where the
						<b> apdv</b> came from for my website). I graduated at the University of Newcastle
						with Bachelor of Information Technology majoring in Interactive Media (High Distiction average, 6.7).
						I love mixing my passion and skills for creativity, 
						communications, problem-solving, and technology together to create meaningful impact 
						on people, organisations, decisions, stories, and interactive experiences. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Furthermore, I love exploring different aspects of emerging
						technology such as business and	data analysis, artificical intelligence, and 
						human-computer interaction. 
					</p>

					<p>
					While living in 4 different countries, it enthusiastically leads me to see different cultures, 
					lifestyles, and perspectives when interacting with new people from various backgrounds! I am excited to 
					take on new challenges and learn as much as I can in each and every opportunity, big or small. 
					Because I was born and raised in Saudi Arabia for ten years since my Filipino parents are immigrants, 
					then was raised in Qatar for eight years. Now, I am independently residing in Australia for two years.
					</p>

					<p>
					In my free time, I love to join hackathons, spend time with family and friends, 
					create digital + traditional art, read books/comics/manga, and play video games (Stardew Valley, League of Legends,
					Overwatch, and more!).
					</p>
